&lt;p>Through two ethnographic cases – a progressive nonprofit for marginalized students and a Pentecostal campus ministry – I trace the experiences of students who see themselves as strangers on campus and navigate strangerhood through their participation in communal, identity-based groups.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Drawing on four years of fieldwork and 100 interviews with students, recent graduates, and organizational staff, I explore how students’ beliefs and moral commitments evolve, how they sustain rare identities through participation in communal groups, and the practical challenges they face trying to build inclusive organizations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How culture shapes action</title><link>https://krystallaryea.github.io/projects/culture/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://krystallaryea.github.io/projects/culture/</guid><description>&lt;p>I examine how culture and meaning-making shape individual, social, and organizational outcomes in multiple independent and collaborative projects. In my paper, “Semiotic Shifts,” I advance existing debates in cultural sociology by theorizing how strategies of action evolve in the face of semiotic shifts, which occur when people enter institutional contexts and encounter new meanings for their beliefs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I theorize three modal strategies that people adopt in the face of semiotic shifts – distancing, bridging, and burrowing. I find that these strategies are linked to the cultural forms that students’ beliefs embodied prior to college (as common sense, tradition, and ideology). This paper is under review; a preprint is available here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a collaborative paper recently published in American Sociological Review, we use mixed methods to show how religious habitus shapes educational outcomes, especially for women. We argue that Jewish women grow up in religious cultural contexts that shape their self-concepts (and the centrality of higher education and career), which helps explain religious differences in vertical and horizontal stratification in educational attainment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With Elizabeth Trinh, we are studying how nonprofit leaders strive to cultivate meaningful work environments and draw on personal sources of meaning to do so. Finally, in an article published in the Journal of Higher Education, my colleagues and I theorize how people interpret and utilize ambiguous credentials, using the case of massively open online courses (a low-status credential offered by high-status universities). We reveal the risks and opportunities faced by learners seeking to leverage ambiguous credentials in the labor market.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How organizations relate to their environments</title><link>https://krystallaryea.github.io/projects/organizations/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://krystallaryea.github.io/projects/organizations/</guid><description>&lt;p>Christof Brandtner and I are writing a series of papers that examine the mechanisms by which organizations produce integration in their urban environments. Sociologists have found that the density of nonprofits influences urban outcomes, but there is a lack of clarity on how and why this happens.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We theorize a critical distinction between the organizational production of social integration (connecting people to one another) and systemic integration (connecting people to complex systems, such as the economy or politics). We then examine the organizational practices that enable the production of each.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In our first paper, we identify two modal forms of expertise (street-level and suite-level expertise, embodied by staff and volunteers) that shape organizational capacity to produce social and systemic integration, respectively.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In our second paper, we theorize the internal processes that enable organizations pursue both forms of integration simultaneously: loose demographic coupling and communal anchoring. This paper advances work at the intersection of organizations and inequality by revealing how inequalities are justified in nonprofits, as women and minorities are relegated to the underpaid but morally valorized work of “community building.”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The formation and maintenance of civic commitments</title><link>https://krystallaryea.github.io/projects/commitments/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://krystallaryea.github.io/projects/commitments/</guid><description>&lt;p>In an article under review, I theorize how communal participation is sustained in the face of change, using the case of a religious community that shifted to a remote format during the coronavirus pandemic and highlighting the process of reframing in driving participation patterns. In an article published in &lt;em>Mobilization&lt;/em>, my colleagues and I draw on a longitudinal, mixed-methods study to show how predisposition and social movement involvement in college intersect to shape trajectories of activism and civic engagement over time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Organizations as Agents of Social and Systemic Integration: Contradiction and Reconciliation Through Loose Demographic Coupling and Community Anchoring</title><link>https://krystallaryea.github.io/publications/laryea_agents_2022/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://krystallaryea.github.io/publications/laryea_agents_2022/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Reframing the Community: How Member Participation Shifts in the Face of Spatial Change</title><link>https://krystallaryea.github.io/publications/laryea_reframing_2022/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://krystallaryea.github.io/publications/laryea_reframing_2022/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Diversity as a Civil Religion</title><link>https://krystallaryea.github.io/publications/laryea_diversity_2022/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://krystallaryea.github.io/publications/laryea_diversity_2022/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Street Smarts and Org Charts: Professional Expertise and The Production of Urban Integration</title><link>https://krystallaryea.github.io/publications/brandtner_street_2022/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://krystallaryea.github.io/publications/brandtner_street_2022/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Predicting the Onset, Evolution and Postgraduate Impact of College Activism</title><link>https://krystallaryea.github.io/publications/mcadam_predicting_2022/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://krystallaryea.github.io/publications/mcadam_predicting_2022/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Abstract:&lt;/strong> The topics of differential recruitment to activism and its longer-term impacts have generated substantial empirical research. Yet, the lack of longitudinal studies of movement participation have limited our understanding of individual activism’s dynamics over time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here, we use six years of longitudinal survey data and two waves of interview data from a class of college students before, throughout, and after college to examine predictors of variation in college activism, the ebb and flow of activism over the course of college, and the effect of college activism on activism two years post-graduation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our findings dispute one consistent empirical claim in social movement studies and confirm another. Counter to the scholarly finding on the weak impact of predisposition on recruitment, we find that predisposition powerfully predicts variation in college activism.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consistent with the claim that significant early activism is linked with future activism, we find that students’ activism at the end of college significantly predicts their engagement in activism after graduation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>San Francisco Bay Area: A Left Coast Metropolis Grapples with Technocracy and Inequality</title><link>https://krystallaryea.github.io/publications/laryea_san_2022/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://krystallaryea.github.io/publications/laryea_san_2022/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Abstract:&lt;/strong> How do civic organizations in the San Francisco Bay Area straddle the paradox of challenging entrenched inequalities in an ostensibly progressive region that has been transformed by tech-driven wealth? Local nonprofits face the tension of maintaining access to elite resources while building connections to distribute those resources and navigate divides between the haves and have-nots.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We draw on original data collected over the course of two decades on a representative sample of Bay Area nonprofit organizations. With rich information from both quantitative and qualitative data, we examine different aspects of nonprofits’ relationship to their constituents and environments, including their community embeddedness, cross-sector collaborations, and engagement in advocacy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We then turn to the internal operations of these organizations and survey the professional backgrounds of nonprofit leaders and the usage of practices that purportedly make nonprofits more professional, accountable, and digitally savvy. Our findings reveal a sector that is developing its own model of what community-directed management looks like, neither tethered strictly to a Left Coast ethos nor displaying uniform responses to strong institutional pressures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although the Bay Area sector pursues heterogeneous approaches to repairing social ruptures, there is a consistent theme of rebuilding and re-creating community. We argue that the region’s diversity in values, practices, and orientations stems from fighting deep fractures that resist simple solutions in a place marked by paradox.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Up-playing Difference: The Micro-foundations of Inclusion in Group Life</title><link>https://krystallaryea.github.io/publications/laryea_up-playing_2022/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://krystallaryea.github.io/publications/laryea_up-playing_2022/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Organizations and Their Significant Others: Collective Identity as a Dialogic Process</title><link>https://krystallaryea.github.io/publications/laryea_significant-others_2022/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://krystallaryea.github.io/publications/laryea_significant-others_2022/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Semiotic Shifts: How Culture Shapes Religious Students’ Navigation of a Secular Institution</title><link>https://krystallaryea.github.io/publications/laryea_semiotic_2022/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://krystallaryea.github.io/publications/laryea_semiotic_2022/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Leading The Way: Examining the Influence of Meaningful Work on Leadership</title><link>https://krystallaryea.github.io/publications/laryea_leading_2022/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://krystallaryea.github.io/publications/laryea_leading_2022/</guid><description/></item><item><title>From Bat Mitzvah to the Bar: Religious Habitus, Self-Concept, and Women’s Educational Outcomes</title><link>https://krystallaryea.github.io/publications/horwitz_bat_2022/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://krystallaryea.github.io/publications/horwitz_bat_2022/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Abstract:&lt;/strong> This study considers the role of religious habitus and self-concept in educational stratification. We follow 3,238 adolescents for 13 years by linking the National Study of Youth and Religion to the National Student Clearinghouse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Survey data reveal that girls with a Jewish upbringing have two distinct postsecondary patterns compared to girls with a non-Jewish upbringing, even after controlling for social origins: (1) they are 23 percentage points more likely to graduate college, and (2) they graduate from much more selective colleges. We then analyze 107 interviews with 33 girls from comparable social origins interviewed repeatedly between adolescence and emerging adulthood. Girls raised by Jewish parents articulate a self-concept marked by ambitious career goals and an eagerness to have new experiences.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For these girls, elite higher education and graduate school are central to attaining self-concept congruence. In contrast, girls raised by non-Jewish parents tend to prioritize motherhood and have humbler employment aims. For them, graduating from college, regardless of its prestige, is sufficient for self-concept congruence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We conclude that religious subculture is a key factor in educational stratification, and divergent paths to self-concept congruence can help explain why educational outcomes vary by religion in gendered ways.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Analyzing semi-structured interviews with 60 people who devoted substantial time to at least one MOOC between 2014–2017, we find that people use MOOCs to build skills for application at work and home, build relationships, navigate life transitions, and enhance formal presentations of self, at the same time that they disagree on the meaning of MOOC completions as official academic accomplishments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our findings build theory on the multi-dimensional character of credential prestige that can inform educational social scientists and credential providers in an increasingly complicated postsecondary ecosystem.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Welcome to Wowchemy, the website builder for Hugo</title><link>https://krystallaryea.github.io/post/getting-started/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://krystallaryea.github.io/post/getting-started/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="overview">Overview&lt;/h2>

In this repeated measures, mixed-methods study, we examined the relationship of purpose to coping with adversity among young adolescents.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A sample of 1357 adolescents completed a survey about purpose, negative life events, and positive reframing coping four times at six month intervals. A sub-sample of 91 survey respondents participated in an interview. Surveys were analyzed using fixed-effects and mixed-effects modeling to test the relationship between purpose and coping over time. Interviews were analyzed for purpose, adversity, and coping to understand this relationship as perceived by the participant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Survey results indicate that purpose and positive reframing coping are related and change together over time. Interview results suggest that purpose can be a response to negative experiences.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are likely underlying factors or processes driving the relationship between purpose and positive reframing coping. Some of the potential underlying factors and processes are discussed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Slides</title><link>https://krystallaryea.github.io/slides/example/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://krystallaryea.github.io/slides/example/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="create-slides-in-markdown-with-wowchemy">Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy&lt;/h1>
